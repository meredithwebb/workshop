# Geospatial Data in the Fight Against Malaria in Africa
## Introduction
Malaria is an infectious disease spread by mosquito bites and is prevalent around the world.  The spread of malaria has declined drastically and is almost completely eliminated in many areas previously burdened by the disease.  However, in sub-Saharan and central Africa, the disease continues to have crippling effects on communities.  Half a billion cases of malaria and two million malaria-deaths are recorded every year, and out of those cases, half of them are children in sub-Saharan Africa. Inadequate health care, poor housing, and the most deadly malaria vector being most widespread in Africa has caused the disease to continue to exist and negatively affect African communities. Many improvements and advancements have been made in treatment and prevention in the past twenty years. It is evident, though, that there is much work to be done and a gap in research exists that causes the disease to continue to affect African communities.  
The task of combating malaria is both extremely important and complex.  Malaria infects 300 million people every year, with 90% of malaria-related deaths occurring in Sub-Saharan Africa [4]. Though this number is slowing down, in 2018 half of the world’s population was at risk for malaria. The groups most at risk for the disease are infants, pregnant women, patients with HIV/AIDs, and mobile populations [5]. There is a fundamental need for precise local information on malaria as more countries approach elimination and are burdened by difficulties of funding, insecticide resistance, and antimalarial resistance [6].  Environmental conditions--such as climate and distance to water sources--, land use, agricultural processes, socioeconomic status, and quality of housing were all components in the presence of malaria in a given area. The World Health Organization (WHO) has been involved in many malaria initiatives, such as the WHO Global Technical Strategy and the Global Malaria Eradication Programme (GMEP.) The WHO-led Global Malaria Eradication Programme (GMEP) highlighted many benefits from international collaboration including: regular data sharing and coordination, special border zones for intensified activities, and administrative systems for health personnel from each country to readily transit borders. GMEPs structures were widely successful in its efforts to decrease malaria in many regions. The new WHO Global Technical Strategy for Malaria takes after that and highlights a need for a deeper regional collaboration [7].
## Research Question and Inquiry 
Throughout my research, I explored different data methods that have been used to analyze the spread of malaria.  I was curious about why malaria has stayed prevalent in Africa where it ceased to exist in other countries.  Therefore, my research question is: What factors affect the presence of malaria, and what geospatial data science methods are being used to identify and predict these factors?  This investigation into a geospatial human development process seeks to answer an explanatory and descriptive inquiry.  I wanted to know what variables cause malaria to be an issue in Africa, while also understanding malaria’s current level of prevalence in Africa.  In order to come up with an effective solution for combating the disease, scientists need to know why its happening and what its current effect is.  Geospatial data can be effective in identifying these two things.  As seen in figure 1, there are many different facets of geospatial science that can be applied to malaria elimination.

## Methods
### Method 1: Bayesian spatio-temporal modeling
Bayesian modeling combines prior distribution on model parameters and the data likelihood to derive the posterior distribution to summarize the behavior in the light of observed data.  Spatiotemporal models are models in which data is collected across time and space.  Two of the studies I investigated used Bayesian approaches to analyze malaria in Africa. 
Mortality data, collected from 2007-2012, from the HDSS in Western Kenya was analyzed using Bayesian spatio-temporal survival models.  The researches investigated a relationship between mortality, in malaria-specific cases, and malaria incidence across all age groups.  Adjusted for insecticide-treated net ownership, socioeconomic status, and distance to health facilities and altitude, this study used estimates obtained to quantify excess mortality due to exposure to the disease [1].  As seen in figure 2 and figure 3, the researchers identified a strong positive relationship between the slide positivity rate (SPR) and all-cause mortality in young children ages 1-4 years.  The slide positivity rate is the number of laboratory-confirmed malaria cases per 100 suspected cases examined.  It has been used as a surrogate measure of malaria incidence, but limited data exists on the relationship between SPR and the incidence of malaria, which makes these findings and this method important [2].

This method was useful and effective in showing that SPR as a measure of transmission captures well the association between malaria transmission intensity and all-cause/malaria mortality.  It offers a quick, efficient way of measuring and monitoring malaria burden on communities, which is needed in order to find a sustainable solution to the problem. 
###Method 2: Satellite Environmental Data
Due to the spread of malaria coming from mainly mosquitoes, environmental factors are vital to understanding the prevalence of malaria.  Certain climates and elevations are more ideal for mosquitoes to live in and therefore can predict the presence of the disease.  Also, areas with lower quality housing are more susceptible to the disease.  In the specific article I chose, a study utilized remote sensing data and terrain-based landscape indices in Zambia in order to identify malaria vector breeding habitats.  
In the Mapanza Chiefdom, transmission is seasonal and the Anopheles arabiensis is the dominant malaria vector.  By identifying larval habitats, policy makers can help focus control measures. The researchers in this study conducted a survey in 2007 at the end of the rainy season to identify and map locations of water pooling and the occurrence of the dominant malaria vector habitats.  They then applied logistic regression and generalized linear mixed modeling to assess the predictive value of terrain-based landscape indices.  Also, they used LandSat imagery to find aquatic habitats, specifically those with anopheline mosquito larvae.  Through this research, they identified 200 aquatic habitats with 69% positive for nine species of anopheline mosquitoes -- as seen in Figure 4.  

![Figure 4](https://meredithwebb.github.io/workshop/Screen%20Shot%202020-04-23%20at%2012.18.38%20AM.png)
They found that the dominant malaria vector was prevalent with terrain-based landscape indices combined with LandSat predicted sites with water.  They were successful in eliminating possible locations but have limited ability in predicting with anopheline species inhabited aquatic sites.  Also, they concluded terrain indices derived from 90 meter Shuttle Radar Topography Mission digital elevation data were better at predicting water drainage patterns and characterizing the landscape than those derived from 30 m Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer digital elevation data. 
The researchers concluded that with the low number of aquatic habitats available and the ability to locate these locations for surveillance, larval control may be a cost-effective control measure in the fight against malaria. In areas of seasonal malaria transmission, using terrain-based landscape models to plan vector control allows for focus and efficiency [3].  The availability of satellite imagery such as SRTM and Landsat is increasing and free.  This bodes well for an expansion of the usage of this type of method for vector management plans.  
## Comparison and Possible Gaps in Research
Both methods are equally important to the elimination of malaria in Africa.  Policy makers need to be able to accurately quantify the damage from malaria and current incidence, while also identifying environmental variables of the causes of the disease.  A potential gap in the research is simply further exploration of SPR as a measure of transmission. There are currently few studies that explore this.  Along the same token, further use of satellite data to locate vector sites is needed. The study I investigated focused mainly on seasonal cases of malaria, which is not able to be generalized necessarily to other areas in Africa where it is prevalent year-round.
