Our question related to the reading for today.  Nieves et a. use the random forest machine learning method to predict what value globally?  Describe in detail how random forest works.  What is a dasymmetric population allocation? Which geospatial covariates proved to be the most important when predicting global values of where humans reside?
 
This reading explained research conducted by Nieves and other scientists that used the random forest machine learning method to assess the relationships between population densities and candidate correlates and drivers.  Random forests are an ensemble approach in which the data is not set to a normal distribution.  They construct a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputs the class that is the classification or regression of the individual trees.  Dasymmetric population allocation is a geospatial technique that uses information such as land cover types to more accurately distribute data that have been assigned to selected boundries like census blocks.  It takes individual grid cells and adds them up into a distribution.  The geospatial coveriates proved to be the most important when predicting global values of where humans reside were topographical features, specifically for urban areas.  Globally, the five most important were urban/suburban proxies, climatic/ environmental variables, populated place covariates, and transportantion networks.  These results matched expectations.
