## Question 1 :

The technique Stevens used that is explored in this reading is called random foresting, which is a machine learning dassymetric approach. In this reading, they use a random forest model, which is a estimation model using decision trees and data that is not on a normal distribution. This random foresting examined variables in order to get precise population density estimations.  

## Question 2 :
Machine learning algorithms are models anda algorithms for which when the machine is given more data, it adjusts and produces a more accurate output.  The machine learns by being given data.  The random forest machine learning allows the technology to assess the accuracy of each variable applied to the map, and in turn, the model expresses the data in a way that can be looked at in an unbiased way.

## Question 3 :
The researchers used data collected on a large scale, with variables such as water, roads, trees, and building types.  Big data can allow for accurate predictions and show significance of variables that would be determined to be insignificant if examined on a smaller scale.  This is benefitial to researchers when trying to make predictions and conclusions.

## Question 4 :
An accurate population density could be very benefitial to governments, non-profit organizations, and charities that exist to aid people in need.  By being able to see exactly where people are and how many people are there in that area makes it easier and more efficient to distribute resources.  Also, using these models, organizations could see where specific types of aid is needed.  For example, if it is evident that there is a large population density near an area with no water source, then an organization would know to help bring a water source there to improve the quality of life in the area.

## Question 5 :
For my topic, malaria in Sub-Saharan Africa, having a highly accurate description of where each household and person is located across planet earth would help when assessing how malaria prevelant areas differ in population than areas without a large exposure to malaria.  Also, in some of the resources I came across, it was said that the type of housing a person has highly effects their chance of getting malaria-- the more modern, the less of a chance to obtain the disease.  Therefore, by knowing which type of area a population is located, researchers could make conclusions and predictions about the types of housing the person has and if they are in need of malaria preventing resources such as nets or vaccines.
