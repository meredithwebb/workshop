# Malaria in Africa
## Problem Statement
Malaria is an infectious disease spread by mosquito bites that is prevelant around the world, but most notably in sub-Sarahan Africa; half a billion cases and two million deaths are recorded every year, and out of those cases, half of them are children in sub-Saharan Africa.  With poor housing, inadequate health care, and the most effective malaria vector-- the mosquito Anopheles gambiae-- being most widespread in Africa, the disease has yet to be eliminated and continues to negatively effect African communities. 
 
### 1. Housing Improvements and Malaria Risk in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Multi-Country Analysis of Survey Data

This article explored the idea that improvements to housing may contribute to the reduction of the spread of malaria.  Malaria is spread by mosquitos, therefore improvements in housing could lessen exposer to biting.  The scientists in this article tested the hypothesis that the odds of obtaining malaria are lower in modern housing than traditional housing in sub-Saharan Africa. They analyzed Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS). In these surveys,conducted in 21 countries, developed a binary housing variable where houses built using finished wall, roof, and floor materials were classified as "modern," and all other houses were classified as "traditional."  Across all 284,532 surveys conducted, modern housing was associated with a 9-14% reduction in the odds of malaria infection.  From this study, they could conclude that housing quality is an important risk factor for malaria infection.  Housing improvements is a promising intervention for sustainable malaria control.  

Amartya Sen's definition of human developement explores development as a catalyst for human freedoms and opportunities.  The switch from traditional to modern housing in Sub-Saharan Africa would expand people's freedoms in the sense that without the major threat of malaria, they could spend their time and money on other activities and opportunities.   

This article related to many different types of human development topics, including infrastructure, poverty analysis, and resource management and allocation. They conducted their analyses in Stata with variables like housing quality, insecticide-treated net use, household wealth, association between housing quality and malaria infection, and association between insecticide-treated net use and malaria infection. The authors acknowledge that insecticide- treated nets and indoor residual spraying are highly effective methods of vector control, but additional actions must be taken for long-term, sustainable control of the disease.  This is where housing improvements could play a part in advancing human development in these areas by providing a sustainable way to reduce cases of the disease.  However, housing is not the only solutuion.  There are many options for solutions that must be explorred, like any major human development issue.
