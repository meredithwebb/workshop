In Selim Jahan's podcast episodes, he presents the idea that economic development has dominated the idea of human development.  He argues that human development should be more focused on the richness of life than monetary gains.  
 
Jahan references many issues that require focus around the world. He talks about youth employment, the informal sector, and agriculture.  The informal sector is still part of the economy but is not formalized, like jobs that are "under the table" or illegal.  He also argues that work is different than jobs and employment.  Work includes hobbies and things that contribute to overall health.  He presents the idea  that we need to include work in human development because they are important to overall wellbeing.  

He says that the Human Development Index is just a measure of human development, it does not capture the totality of the notion of human development.  This means that any conclusion taken from this index should also consider the fact that it could miss key elements.  Human development uses two measures: breadth and focus.  The breadth shows different indicators of human development that can then be analyzed.  The focus measure is like the Human development Index that focuses on three things: a long and healthy life, knowledge, and a decent standard of living. 

Hans Rosling states that "we underestimate the tremendous social change that often precedes economic change."  The prime example he uses in this instance is China.  China's communist society does not only effect their economic structure, but also the way their society operates.
